$This shows that my language can successfully implement iteration.
$The only support forms are while loops.

define main()   {

    print("The following will print the numbers 1 to 50 using a while loop.");
    x = 1;

    $Print the numbers 1 to 50
    while(x != 51)  {
        print(x);
        x = x + 1;
    }

}

main();
