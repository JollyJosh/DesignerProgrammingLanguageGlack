$This file will show that my DPL can handle creating arrays
$and accessing arrays in constant time. It will also show
$that array indices can be expressions that will return some number
$to be used as the index.

define help(x)   {
    x = x + 1;
    x;
}
define main()   {

    $Create an array with the built in function "array" and pass
    $in a size (5 for this example).
    a = array(5);

    $Arrays are zero indexed so now index 0-4 contains "null".

    $Set array at index 1 to 25
    a[1] = 25;

    $Print the array value at index 1 by passing in a 0 to help
    $which will return a 1 and using that as the index.

    print("This should print null to show that the values are initialized to null following this line.");
    print(a[0]);

    print("This should print the value 25 following this line.");
    print(a[help(0)]);
}
main();
