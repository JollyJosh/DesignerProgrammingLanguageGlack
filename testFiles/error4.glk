$This is the fourth error file, and the first semantic error file.
$This file will throw an error when trying to compare two strings
$with an inequality other than equals and not equals
$(ie. less than, greater than, etc). In this language only integers
$can be compared for those types of equalities.

define main()   {

    $This comparison fails
    if("hello" < "hello world") {
        print("This will error.");
    }
    else    {
        print("I really hope I pass this class.");
    }

}
main();
