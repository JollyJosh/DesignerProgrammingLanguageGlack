$This is the third and final syntax error file
$This file will throw an error in the function definition
$for not having an arg list that ends in a comma which signifies
$that it is expecting an id for another variable instead of the end
$of the arg list.

$According to the grammar, another argument should follow x since
$there is a comma.

define main(x,) {
    print(x);
}
